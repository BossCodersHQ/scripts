# Scripts Make the World Go Round üåç

This project is a collection of random scripts I use for daily life (often in conjuction with zapier & AWS)

## Setup

To set up the project, you need to use Poetry to manage dependencies and create a virtual environment.

### Step 1: Install Poetry

If you don't have Poetry installed, you can install it by following the instructions on the [Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using Poetry:

```sh
poetry install
```

This will create a virtual environment and install all the required dependencies specified in the `pyproject.toml` file.

### Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment

To activate the virtual environment, use the following command:

```bash
poetry shell
```
